        <p><h4><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) </b>is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. 
            It consists of a series of elements or tags that define the structure of web pages, such as<b> headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and more</b>. 
            HTML provides a way to organize and display text, images, videos, and interactive forms in web browsers. 
            While HTML itself is primarily concerned with structure, 
            it works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
            By using HTML, web developers can design websites and web applications that are accessible and viewable across different devices and platforms. 
            It serves as the foundation for nearly every webpage on the internet.</p></h4>
